So this is where I will plan future updates..

Features:
-some default playlists from spotify api
-add play-list and make it go through all songs only once, without repeating songs
-add shuffle (advanced)
-socket io? (advanced)
-station editing (thumbnail, name, tags etc.) --Can be easily done after station redux update
-removing station from likedStations (sync it with mongodb)


Fixes:
-volume bar css
-seek css
-Use .env with node
-add res status codes to errors in throw/catch on the backend side
