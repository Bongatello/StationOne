So this is where I will plan future updates..

Features:
-add shuffle (advanced)
-socket io? (advanced)
-station editing (thumbnail, name, tags etc.) --Can be easily done after station redux update
-removing station from likedStations (sync it with mongodb)
-Liked Stations
-Modals (smart modal component)
-Explore (or browse, whatever its called) page
-Search for songs using the actual header search bar
-Add counter(index) to stations created for station default naming
-recently played stations (just copy mini stations to user.recentStations database collection object)
-User auth?
-Anything else boss?
-Pray for no schedule changes.........
-Get more songs from the spotify playlists (limited to 100 currently)
-Add explicit icon to explicit songs on stations


Fixes:
-volume bar css
-seek css
-Use .env with node
-add res status codes to errors in throw/catch on the backend side
-Look for more bugs or potential fixes in code by letting friends use the site? just like beta testing
