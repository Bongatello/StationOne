So this is where I will plan future updates..

Features:
Most significant features:
-Modals (smart modal component)                                                                                     done, just needs more dynamic cmps
-playing gif wherever needed                                                                                        added in some places
-mobile version                                                                                                     currently working on it
-clone playlist
-Explore (or browse, whatever its called) page      


Less significant feautres:
-Get more songs from the spotify playlists (limited to 100 currently)
-Add explicit icon to explicit songs on stations
-add shuffle (advanced)


Fixes:
-Use .env with node
-add res status codes to errors in throw/catch on the backend side
-Look for more bugs or potential fixes in code by letting friends use the site? just like beta testing
-fix station name shrinking weirdly
-Change library list to get album/station/playlist type
-Can't skip songs in albums



-Mobile CSS progression:

-Station Preview was almost done until i noticed that the mobile web version is outdated, and the app looks a little different, except that its lookin good
-Fixed double players being enabled (2 player components being mounted)
-Need to add ColorThief to the player
-Need to add links to different pages on footer, and create the footer itself, should be really easy because its only literally only 4 svgs + 3 links, and a create-button-modal
-Need to add "back" button to stations topleft
-Need to add a "stopped playing" visualizer to the songs in stations (since I couldnt really find the svg for it due to it appearing only inside the updated app)
-More changes to the updated mobile station

-More mobile pages (library, home and search, should be easy if using the existing ones)
