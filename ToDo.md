So this is where I will plan future updates..

Features:
Most significant features:
-Modals (smart modal component)                                                                                     done, just needs more dynamic cmps
-socket io? (advanced)
-playing gif wherever needed
-mobile version
-clone playlist

Less significant feautres:
-Get more songs from the spotify playlists (limited to 100 currently)
-Add explicit icon to explicit songs on stations
-add shuffle (advanced)
-Explore (or browse, whatever its called) page                                                                                                 next?

Fixes:
-Use .env with node
-add res status codes to errors in throw/catch on the backend side
-Look for more bugs or potential fixes in code by letting friends use the site? just like beta testing
-fix station name not shrinking when being wider than screen
