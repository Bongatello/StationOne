      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p>I will be using this page for user authentication and first-time explanation,</p>
      <p>So for now, playlist creation should work perfectly fine, with thumbnail setting automatically to first song added, unless all songs have been deleted which returns it into a blank thumbnail</p>
      <p>Searching for playlists/songs/albums etc. on the search bar, on the top of the page works, including showcase and play,pause,skip functionality on both playlist and albums</p>
      <p>The pre-made playlists you will come across are spotify-user-made playlists</p>
      <p>Home page should include your recent played playlists, id guess its still broken for albums right now, will work on a fix later on</p>
      <p>Library-bar should also work except for the sorting methods, which would be worked on later</p>
      <p>So for now the library-bar is for saved/liked/created playlists and playlist creation only</p>
      <p>Listening with friends is a little tricky for now, will make it much more user friendly later on, but contact me if you want to try it out</p>
      <p>Explore/Browse page is kinda impossible to re-create unless its genres/collections are hard-coded because spotify doesnt share any data about it</p>
      <p>Also since we don't really have the collections or genres, the homepage genres are hard coded but the playlists shown are actually user-made through spotify, and being fetched from the spotify api</p>
      <p>Dragging and dropping will be a more "advanced" feature, just feels kind-of useless right now even though it sounds complicated and cool</p>
      <p>Liking songs and liked songs is not a feature right now</p>
